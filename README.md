# VersionOne.SDK.JavaScript 

API client for use with JavaScript or CoffeeScript, either from Node.JS on the server.

We're also trying to get it to work from the browser too.

## Getting Started With [`sample.js`](sample.js)

To build the libraries, you'll need Node.js and CoffeeScript installed.

To install CoffeeScript:

`npm install coffee-script -g`

Next,to install the other dependencies, type:

`npm install`

Finally, to build, type:

`. ./build.sh`

You can now run the sample against our public test instance by typing:

`node sample.js`

You can modify the info at the top of the script to point to your own VersionOne instance.
